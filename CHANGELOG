### Changed
- modified how date and time is handled: instead of defining the date and time as a "day_of_the_year" integer (1->365), hour integer (0->23) and minutes (0->59) integer, now proper datetime objects are used. Therefore, i.e.:
		sunset_time(n, lat) becomes sunset_time(date, lat)
		theta(n, lat, beta, surf_az, hour, minute) becomes theta(date, lat, beta, surf_az)
- "solar_time" function becomes "standard2solar_time" to reflect that the input is a datetime object with standard local time, and the output is the solar local time.
- improved error raising and handling
- changed
